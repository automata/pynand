# From Nand to Tetris in Python

An alternative language and test harness for doing the exercises from the amazing book/course
[Nand To Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org). This version, in Python, may provide a better 
experience as compared to the tools provided by the authors:

* No need to install Java
* No clunky UI
* You only need Python, a text editor, and basic command-line skills.


## Requirements

You need to have Python installed, at least version 3.6.

Pytest is required to run the tests: `pip3 install pytest`.

For the full Computer simulation including display and keyboard, `pygame` is required:
`pip3 install pygame`. On Mac OS X, you may need to install a dev version: 
`pip3 install pygame==2.0.0dev6`


## Step 1: Do the Exercises

First clone the repo and run `pytest`. All the tests should pass, because the included solutions 
are used for every component.

Now open [project_01.py](project_01.py) in a text editor, find the `mkNot` function, and the line
with `solved_01.Not`. Replace that with `Nand(a=..., b=...)` using the inputs so that it computes 
the expected result.

Run `pytest test_01.py`. If `test_not` passes, you can move on to the next component.

When you're all done, delete the line `from nand.solutions import solved_01` at the top of the 
file to be sure you didn't miss anything. Actually, if you prefer you can start by deleting that 
line, then work on getting the tests to pass one at a time.

That's it for the first chapter. Now move on to `test_02.py`â€¦


## Step 2: Enjoy

Run `python computer.py examples/Pong.asm`. Bask in the glory of a CPU you built from scratch.
Note: the awesomeness starts after about 5 million cycles.


## Step 3: Go Further


### Your CPU Design

The components here can be used to implement any generally similar CPU design. Ideas:

- Make a fancier ALU. What features do you think would be useful?
- Make a better instruction encoding. How can it do more with less?
- Make an even smaller CPU. What can you take away and still get stuff done?

Note: if you want to run any programs, you'll have to figure out how to get them into
your new chip's instruction format. One way to do that is to implement a new VM-assembly 
translator, and find some VM programs to run on both chips for comparison.


### Your Language

What language do you like to write? Can you compile _that_ language, or something like it, to
the Hack VM? Or directly to assembly?
